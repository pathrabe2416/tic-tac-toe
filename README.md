🧩 Game Logic

The game board is made of 9 buttons arranged in a grid.

Players alternate turns to place "O" and "X".

After each move, the game checks:

If any winning pattern is matched

If all boxes are filled (for a draw)

When a win is detected, an alert shows the winner, and further moves are disabled.

"Reset" only clears the board but retains the current player.

"New Game" clears the board and resets the turn to Player O.
